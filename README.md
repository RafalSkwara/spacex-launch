This is a small SPA created as an exercise to teach myself basics of both React and Redux.

It uses SpaceX's open API which provides information about all previous and planned rocket launches. The app can filter entries by rocket name and display clicked item's details also extracted from API.

The environment setup is based on daftcode-react-starter project.
